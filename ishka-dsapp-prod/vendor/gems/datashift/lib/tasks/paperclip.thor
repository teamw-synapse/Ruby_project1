    desc 'attach', "Create paperclip attachments and attach to a Model from files in a directory.
    This is specifically for the use case where the paperclip attachments are stored in a class, such as Image, Icon, Asset,
    and this class has a relationship, such as belongs_to, with another class, such as Product, User, Document.

    Each matching file is used to create an instance of the paperclip attachment, given by :attachment_klass.

    The class with the relationship, can be specified via :attach_to_klass

      Examples
        Owner has_many pdfs and mp3 files as Digitals .... :attachment_klass = Digital and :attach_to_klass = Owner
        User has a single Image used as an avatar ... attachment_klass = Image and :attach_to_klass = User

    The file name is used to lookup the instance of :attach_to_klass to assign the new attachment to, via :attach_to_find_by_field

    So say we have a file called smithj_avatar.gif, and we want to lookup Users by login

        :attach_to_find_by_field = login => Run a loookup based on find_by_login == 'smithj'

    Once instance of :attach_to_klass found, the new attachment is assigned.

     The attribute to assign new attachment to is gtiven by :attach_to_field

     Examples
        :attach_to_field => digitals  : Owner.digitals = attachment(Digital)
        :attach_to_field => avatar    : User.avatar = attachment(Image)"

    #       For the :attach_to_klass, this is the field used to search for the parent
    #       object to assign the new attachment to.
    #     Examples
    #       Owner has a unique 'name' field ... :attach_to_find_by_field = :name
    #       User has a unique  'login' field  ... :attach_to_klass = :login

    #         :attach_to_field => avatar    : User.avatar = attachment
