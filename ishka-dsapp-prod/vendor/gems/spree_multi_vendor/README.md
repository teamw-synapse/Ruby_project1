# Spree Multi Vendor

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/spree-contrib/spree_multi_vendor.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/spree-contrib/spree_multi_vendor)

This is a [spree multi vendor marketplace](https://spreecommerce.org/use-cases/multi-vendor-marketplace/) extension. It's a great starting point if you're building a marketplace on top of [Spree](https://spreecommerce.org). Our goal was flexibility to allow you to tweak it to your needs. 

Check out this extension [multi vendor marketplace demo](https://spreecommerce.org/launch-a-multi-vendor-marketplace-within-a-few-weeks-with-spree-commerce/) and launch your marketplace within weeks, not months.
